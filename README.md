Break a Monolithic Application into Microservices with AWS Copilot, Amazon ECS and ECR, Docker, and AWS Fargate

This repository contains the code and resources for the tutorial [Breaking a Monolithic Application into Microservices with AWS ECS, Docker, and EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/tutorials/break-monolith-app-microservices-ecs-docker-ec2/module-one/) provided by Amazon Web Services.

## Overview

In this tutorial, I'll break down a monolithic application into microservices using various AWS services including ECS (Elastic Container Service), Docker, and EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). I will do this in a few different steps shown below:

1. Module One: Introduction to Microservices and the Monolithic Application
2. Module Two: Containerize the Monolithic Application with Docker
3. Module Three: Deploy the Docker Container to Amazon ECS
4. Module Four: Scale the Microservices with ECS and EC2
5. Module Five: Implement CI/CD for Microservices with AWS CodePipeline

## Module One: Introduction to Microservices and the Monolithic Application

In this module, I'll explore the concepts of microservices and monolithic applications. The aim is to understand the characteristics of each architecture and the benefits of transitioning from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization
- Basic knowledge of AWS ECS and EC2
